# Simple Note Web Application

This is a simple web application built with the Laravel framework that allows users to manage notes. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

## Features

- List All Notes: All created notes are displayed in a list format.
- Create New Note: Users can create new notes by providing a name and description.
- Edit a Note: Users can edit existing notes.
- Delete a Note: Users can delete notes they no longer need.

## How It Works

1. List All Notes: The application displays a list of all notes stored in the database. This page will display first.
1. Create New Note: When the user wants to create a new note, they fill in the form with a name and description. The note is then saved to the database.
2. Edit a Note: The user can view a list of all created notes. By selecting a note, the user can edit its name and description.
3. Delete a Note: If a note is no longer needed, the user can delete it, and it will be removed from the database.
